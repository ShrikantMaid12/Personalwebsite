					 <h2>Like tsunami, floods + deadly debris</h2><br/>
<p>Like a rampaging tsunami, but with more destructive debris that tore up everything in its path.</p>
 
<p>This was how a University of the Philippines geologist described the 
flash floods that hit Iligan City at the height of Tropical Storm 
“Sendong” which left more than 400 dead in the city alone.</p>
<p>Alfredo Mahar Lagmay explained that the rushing waters which came 
from the upstream part of the Mandulog River were so strong that they 
swept away everything in their path—from rocks, mud, to whole trees.</p>
<p>“It was like a tsunami, but with more debris that made it even more 
erosive,” Lagmay said, as he described the extent of the 
“hyperconcentrated” flash flood’s strength.</p>

<p>And while illegal logging in the mountains above the city may have 
been a factor in the destruction, Lagmay said the primary cause of the 
flash floods was the heavy rains.</p>
<p>“Logging—may it be legal or illegal—may have aggravated the floods, 
but the primary reason for this was the extreme rainfall brought about 
by Sendong,” he told a press briefing yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>UP sends a team </strong></p>
<p>Lagmay, a professor at the National Institute of Geological Sciences,
 was part of a team that the university had sent to Iligan City after 
the flash floods which swept away entire homes and communities.</p>
<p>The storm dumped 350 millimeters of rain on northwestern Mindanao on 
the night of Dec. 16 up to the early hours of Dec. 17, causing the flash
 floods that crept in while people slept soundly in their homes.</p>
