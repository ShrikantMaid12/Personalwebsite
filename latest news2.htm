               <p>One hundred and fifteen years after Jose Rizal was executed by the 
Spanish colonial regime, controversy still rages as to whether he was a 
reformist or a revolutionary.</p>

<p>Rizal is immensely influential to generations of Filipinos.&nbsp; How he is viewed can help define the course of our history.</p>
<p>In his Rizal Day Lecture on Dec. 30, 1969, titled “Veneration Without
 Understanding,” the historian Renato Constantino noted it was American 
Governor General William Howard Taft who in 1901 suggested to the 
Philippine Commission the naming of a national hero for Filipinos.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the US-sponsored commission passed Act No. 346 which 
set the anniversary of Rizal’s death as a “day of observance.”</p>
<p>Constantino cites Theodore Friend in his&nbsp; book, “Between Two 
Empires,” as saying that Taft “with other American colonial officials 
and some conservative Filipinos chose him (Rizal)&nbsp; a model hero 
over other contestants—Aguinaldo too militant, Bonifacio too radical, 
Mabini unregenerate.”</p>
<p><strong>Filipinos chose him</strong></p>
<p>The rationale for naming Rizal as the Filipinos’ national hero by the
 American administration was articulated by US Governor General W. 
Cameron Forbes in his book, “The Philippine Islands,” also cited by 
Constantino.&nbsp; Forbes wrote:</p>

<p>“It is eminently proper that Rizal should have become the 
acknowledged national hero of the Philippine people. Rizal never 
advocated independence, nor did he advocate armed resistance to the 
government. He urged reform from within by publicity, by public 
education, and appeal to the public conscience.”</p>
